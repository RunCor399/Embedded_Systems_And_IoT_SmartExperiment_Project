# Embedded Systems and Internet of Things Course Assignment #1
## Made by Colotti Manuel Enrique and Lisotta Marco

The purpose of the assignment was to use Arduino and several other sensors to develop a piece of hardware capable of detecting the motion
of an object passing in front of a Sonar.
The application was developed as a *Smart Experiment Framework*, allowing to graphically visualize collected data such as speed and acceleration of the
object moving in front of the sensor, but also by providing a way to stop a given experiment and start a new one.
A design report written in italian is available for additional information, namely *Assignment2_SEIOT.pdf*
